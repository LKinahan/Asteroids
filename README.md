# Asteroids
inheritance used to implement a simplified version of the game Asteroids

The simplified game of Asteroids will have a number of game elements including the player ship, the asteroids and missiles fired by the ship to destroy the asteroids. All objects will inherit from the same game object and share many of the same characteristics. The ship position (X/Y) will be controlled by the joystick, the same as the Etch-A-Sketch game. Asteroids will randomly appear at the top of the screen and drift at a random angle and speed downwards. By pushing (and/or holding) a button on the controller, the ship can fire missiles upwards towards the asteroids.  The player begins the game with 10 lives. If an asteroid collides with the ship, both the player and asteroid lose a life (life = life - 1). If an asteroid or missile collides with the side of the display, they both lose a life. If an asteroid and missile collide, both lose a life and the player score increases by 10 points.  The CAsteroidGame class will inherit from CBase4618 for the update/draw/run methods and the canvas image. The class should contain a vector for asteroids and one for missiles as well as the other game related member variables. In update, loop over the vector of asteroids and missiles to detect collisions and determine remaining lives, then loop over again and remove any objects with lives <= 0. Finally, loop over the remaining objects to draw
